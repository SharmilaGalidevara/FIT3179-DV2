    <h2>Primary Forest Loss in Malaysia</h2>
    <div class="two-column-layout">
      <div class="description">
        <p>Between 2002 and 2024, Malaysia experienced a loss of 2.99 Mha of humid primary forest, contributing to 33% of its total tree cover loss for that period. Overall, the humid primary forest area in Malaysia saw a 19% reduction.</p>
        <p>This visualization presents the annual tree cover loss within the 2001 primary forest extent (represented by green bars) and tracks the remaining percentage of that 2001 forest area (shown by the dotted line).</p>

    <div class="description">
        <p>Malaysia's total tree cover loss from 2001 to 2024 amounted to 9.51 Mha, equating to 32% of its 2000 tree cover extent and releasing 5.51 Gt of COâ‚‚e emissions. This calculation does not incorporate any tree cover gains during the specified period.</p>
        <p>The chart illustrates the yearly tree cover reduction in Malaysia, measured in hectares. Analyzing these trends offers insights into the prevailing deforestation patterns and their environmental repercussions.</p>
